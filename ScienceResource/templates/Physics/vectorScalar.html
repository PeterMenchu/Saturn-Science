                        <p>Vectors and scalars are quantities that are used throughout physics, and it is important to understand the differences between the two and how they are used.
</p>
                        <h2 style="color: magenta">Scalar Quantities</h2>
                        <p>A scalar is a quantity described by a single value (with appropriate units), and is completely described by that value.</p>
                        <p>These will often be written as single (usually lowercase) letter such as 'a' or 'k'.</p>
                        <p>Examples of Scalars: Height, time, speed, volume, mass, temperature, any physical
quantity that can be completely described by a single magnitude value.
</p>

                        <h2 style="color: magenta">Vector Quantities</h2>
                        <p>A vector is a quantity described by a value (with appropriate units) AND a corresponding direction of that value. Mathematically, it is a directed line segment with the magnitude being its length.
</p>
                        <p>These are written as in the image below, usually an uppercase letter with an arrow above it directed toward the right.</p>
                        <p>Vector Examples: Velocity of an object, the force involved in pulling/pushing something, displacement of an object, weight (direction of force is toward earthâ€™s center), any physical quantity with a magnitude value and direction.</p>
                        <h2 style="color: magenta">Key Distinction</h2>
                        <p>-> between vectors and scalars is vectors require both a value and direction in order to be a vector, whereas a Scalar is strictly only a single value.</p>
